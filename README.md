## Vision 


A program that can summarize any webpage page into a small , simple and informatic design with few sentences which can be read or listened to 
in order to help various people during browsing in different ways. 


## Summary 


![summary logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71225087/93217463-c6fc2580-f771-11ea-9a33-df3a6548c8e6.png)



The model will summsrize a web page text after highlighting it. After the summarization a voice agent will read the new text, 
saving customers time and effort. And it help elders or people with disabilties to have the greatest experince .

*  until now it can just speak english 


*  the model can deal with any webpage:

| like : |
| ------------- |
| wikipidia articles    | 
| any item description on amazon    | 
 

ALL just in one click...  



## Algorithms 

 
### TextRanking Algorithm
 * (NLP)
which link all the text in the articles then split the hole text into individual senteces . 
Every sentence will find a vector representation . Similarities between sentence vectors are then calculated and stored in a matrix . 

The similarity matrix is then converted into a graph, with sentences as vertices and similarity scores as edges, for sentence rank calculation .
all leads to the final suumary (a certain number of top ranked sentences)


## Code

written by python 



 
#### importing the required libraries line [1-5]


* stop_words is a set of default stop words for English language model in spacy which is 
an open source library for (NLP) in python that can be used in deep learning and information extraction (our needs) 

* the string module can help in the event that it contains functions related to strings  

* punctuation is a String of ASCII characters which are considered punctuation characters

* flask for web development issues

* (heapq.nlargest) Return a list with the n largest elements from the dataset

#### line [8- 58] step by step 

* using stop words 
* define a function for summarization (NLP)
* vector represintation of sentences  (extracting)
* creating vectors for the sentences 
* fetchig vectors 
* summary extraction 

#### line [61-84]
* API fitting





## Chrome extension 
The chrome extention was wrriten by javascript and HTML 

the design is simple to satisfy the user experience placing a superb impact 
 
after opening the extension the user will shade the specific text then the new summarized text will be ready to the reader 




## Design
The main goal 
* catching attention with preservation to eye relaxation
* simplicity 
* clear typography

logo | matchless | represent the idea 


## API 

it is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software in our case a web page and the python program
 using (flask) & (json) we had the potential connecting them together . 

* flask api to connect with frontend   


now the model is able to grab a text from any web page and summarize it to the reader with voice emulator


So it's readable and hearable    

The model was finally deployed to PythonAnyWhere


## Future look 

Looking ahead, new trends continue to emerge and merge .
the project development  ( AI & deep learning )  will lead to expantion through every website, e-commerce websites 
allowing customers to enojoy browsing  


a new algorithm that can summarize in smart way. Which can recognize the subject or the category of the text to result in a better summarization to be as much practical as possibble. It would be able to summarize a text giving more weight to the sentences related to its subject.

* such as :
 if we have a router the model will foucs on specific themes related to the product , in this case (speed , Lan ports ,  technology generation , range)

 likewise on other products (sports, clothing , gaming , furniture , etc ...)  
  
 it can also be a scientific article...

We are also thinking of making the speech pace controllable by the user.

## How to run the extension

- Download the files from the repository
- upload the "chrome extension" folder as unpacked chrome extension to chrome
- Highlight the text that you want to summarize in any webpage
- click the icon of the extension to see and listen to the summary
- You don't have to run the main.py file because we already deployed the flask api to pythonanyware.com
